# finding a regex that matches itself

motivation - mosty just for fun of it

do note that it's relatively easy to get a regex that matches itself, but "only itself" is much much harder (if possible)...

to run:
* clone to a specific dirctory
* install python and pip or anaconda
* use pip/anaconda to install jupyter
* run jupyter lab or jupyter notebook at the repos directory
* open compiled.ipynb in jupyter lab/notebook
* uncomment the pip installs and adjust and run if necessary
* run the experiment - it will save progress (candidates.elite) if you press the box "stop" button early
